SYNOPSIS:
This is a simple class structure for dealing with external program execution from within a c++ program running on some posix operating system (linux, unix, bsd, osx, etc).

The hope is that begining programmers will not have to deal with the complexities of forking, system process execution, and timing of executed commands.  The easyExec class should handle everything simply and intuitivly.  

Included with this source code you should also have received a copy of the GPLv3 licence, as well as a driver program /testeasyexecute.cpp/ and a sample compilation script /compile.sh/.  The code should be self-explanatory, and comments are on the verbose side.

If you have any suggetions for improvements or bug fixes, code improvements, etc, please email them on to me and I'll patch the source tree (more like a source bush, considering the low complexity)
